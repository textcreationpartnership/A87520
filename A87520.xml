            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I Have now ſpent Forty five yeares in the Study of the Laws of this Land, being my Profeſſion, under, and by the conduct of which Lawes this Common-wealth hath flouriſhed for ſome ages paſt in great ſplendor and happineſſe <hi>(jam ſeges eſt ubi Troja fuit.)</hi> The great and full body of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hath of late yeares fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an extreame ſickneſſe; it is truely ſaid that the cauſe of the diſeaſe being knowne, the diſeaſe is eaſily cured. There is none of you I hope, but doth heartily wiſh<pb n="2" facs="tcp:119307:14"/>the recovery of our common parent, our native countrey <hi>(Moribus antiquis ſtat res Britannica.)</hi> I call God to witneſſe that this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of mine hath no other end then my wiſhes of the common good: how farre I have been from Ambition my life paſt, and your owne knowledge of me, can abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly informe you: and many of you well know, that I ever dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted the Ship-money and Monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and that in the beginning of this Parliament, for oppoſing the exceſſes of one of the Biſhops, I lay under three Excommunications, &amp; the Examination of ſeventy ſeven Artioles in the high Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Court. His ſacred Majeſty, (God is my witneſſe) made me a Judge in the parts of Wales againſt my will, and all the meanes I was able to make; and a patent formy place was ſent me, for the which I have not paid one farthing, and the place is of ſo inconſiderable a<pb n="3" facs="tcp:119307:14"/>benefit that it is worth but <hi>80. l. per Annum</hi> when paid, and it coſt me every yeare I ſerved twice as much out of my owne eſtate in the way of an ordinary and frugall expence. That which gave me comfort was, that I knew well that his Majeſty was a juſt and a prudent Prince.</p>
                  <p>In the time of the Atturney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips of Maſtor <hi>Noy</hi> and the Lord <hi>Banks,</hi> they were pleaſed to make often uſe of me, and many refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences concerning ſuits at Court upon that occaſion came to my knowledge; and as I ſhall anſwer to God upon my laſt account this is truth, that all or moſt of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrences which I have ſeene in that kind
(and I have ſeene many) were to this effect, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty would be informed by his Councell if the ſuits preferred were agreeable to the Lawes, and not inconvenient to his people, before he would paſſe them, (what could
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:119307:15"/>a juſt and pious Prince doe more?) Gentlemen: you ſhall finde the cauſe and the Cure of the preſent great diſtemper in this diſcourſe, and God proſper it in your hands, thoughts, and words, as the caſe deſerves.</p>
                  <p>Hold to the Lawes, this great body recovers: forſake them, it will certainely periſh. I have reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to tender my ſelfe a Sacrifice for them as cheerefully, and I hope (by Gods aſſiſtance) as conſtantly as old <hi>Eleazer</hi> did for the holy Lawes of his Nation.</p>

                  <p>It will be ſaid notwithſtanding all this fence about the Lawes, the Lawes have been violated, and therefore the ſaid powers muſt not hold, the two Houſes will remedy this.</p>
                  <p>The anſwer to this is evident:<pb n="31" facs="tcp:119307:27"/>There is no time paſt, nor time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, nor will there be time to come, ſo long as men manage the Law; but the Lawes will be broken more or leſſe, as appeares by the ſtory of every age. All the pretended violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this time were remedied by Acts to which the King conſented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his departure 10. <hi>Jan.</hi> 1641. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then driven away by Tumults: And the Houſes for a yeare and almoſt three Moneths, from 3 <hi>Nov.</hi> 1640. to 10 <hi>Jan.</hi> 1641. as aforeſaid, being a yeare and almoſt three Moneths, had time and liberty to queſtion all thoſe perſons who are either cauſes or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of the violation of any of the Lawes.</p>
                  <p>Examine how both Houſes reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died them in former times. Firſt, touching Religion, what hath been done this way? Both Houſes in <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the eights time tendred to him a Bill to be paſſed called commonly the Bill of the ſix Articles, this was conceived by them to be a juſt and a neceſſary Bill: Had not <hi>Henry</hi> the eight done well to have refuſed the paſſing of this Bill? Both Houſes tendred a Bill to him to take the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Scriptures from moſt of the Laity: Had not King <hi>Henry</hi> the<pb n="30" facs="tcp:119307:28"/>eight deſerved much praiſe to reject this Bill?

                  <p>And by the experience of all times, and the conſideration of humane<pb n="31" facs="tcp:119307:28"/>frailty, this concluſion is manifeſtly deduced, that it is not poſſible to keep men at all times (be they the Houſes, or the King and his Councell) but there will be ſometimes ſome devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Lawes, and therefore the conſtant and certaine powers fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ancient Law muſt not be made voyd, and the Kings Miniſters; the Lawes doe puniſh where the Law is tranſgreſſed, and they onely ought to ſuffer for the ſame.</p>

                  <p>M. <hi>Thomas,</hi> whoſe Father and my Grandfather were two Brothers, about ſeventeene yeares paſt made his Will, and declared by the ſame his Son (being then of very tender yeares) a Ward to his Majeſty, and made him Executour, and my ſelfe during his minority, (referring to his Wardſhip,) to Adminiſter his Eſtate perſonall and teſtamentary, and to be accountable to his Son when he came to Age: And ſeventeene yeares ſithence the Father died.</p>
                  <p>This Eſtate conſiſts in a Stocke of Sheepe, ſo diſpoſed by me as the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber are yet continued, and for the number and condition, they were at their delivery backe, to be made as good by thoſe perſons who had the charge of them, as they were when they were received.</p>
                  <p>The reſt of the Eſtate (for any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part) was in Mortgages of<pb n="182" facs="tcp:119307:100"/>Land forfeited in the life of my young Couſin <hi>Thomas</hi> for many of them, &amp; many abſolutely purchaſed by me in his name in his life time, for the which I am not yet payd.</p>
                  <p>The Land diſcended, and ought upon Sir <hi>Edward Thomas,</hi> my conſirs Heire at Common-Law; ſo that Mr. <hi>Ernley,</hi> the Plaintiffe in <hi>Chancery,</hi> hath no colour for the Land: For my young Couſin dyed without iſſue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 17. yeares old, and could not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the Inheritance of any Land, by a pretended Will. The ſtocke of Sheepe remaines, if the Plaintiffe and the <hi>Reformers</hi> have not Plundered them, for the Money it came all to the Court, it was to ſatisfie the King for the Marriage.</p>
                  <p>The colour the Plaintiffe hath, is this; After the death of my olde Kinſman M. <hi>Thomas,</hi> by undue means the young Genrleman was married to M. <hi>Ernleys</hi> Daughter, in a way of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhment, being both children, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out one penny payd, or conſent of Friends or Kindered, For the which a Suit of Raviſhment depended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt M. <hi>Erneley</hi> and others in the Court of <hi>Wards.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The young Gentleman dyed about 17. yeares of age, ſithence theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions<pb n="183" facs="tcp:119307:101"/>without iſſue; and ſome houre before my young Couſins death (who dyed of a peſtilent Feaver) Mr. <hi>Erne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> pretends a Will made by him, and that he made his Wife (M. <hi>Erneleys</hi> Daughter) his Executrix: His ſaid Wife dies ſoon after, &amp; is pretended to make a Nuncapative Will, and to make her Father (M. <hi>Ernley</hi>) her Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor, and ſo pretends as Executor of an Executor of an Executor: which pretended Wills, he ſaith he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Courts of his Freinds, the <hi>Reformers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whether ſuch wills were made or no, muſt receive an equall examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of what validity they are, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pretended to be made by children <hi>in extremis</hi> if made at all?

                  <p>The age touching Wills,

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:119307:101"/>for many ages hath left the ſame to the deceſion of the Civill and Canon Lawes, in the Biſhops Courts: That Law, (as <hi>Juſtinian</hi> hath it in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Bood of his <hi>Inſtitutions,</hi> the 12. <hi>chap.</hi>) is, <hi>Impuberi non licet teſtari:</hi> this <hi>Pubertas</hi> begins at 14. it is <hi>Plena pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertas</hi> at 18 yeares of age: The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is, whether this <hi>jus teſtandi</hi> is in <hi>pubertate plena,</hi> or <hi>pubertate inceptâ. Pigots Caſe,</hi> 5. part of <hi>Cookes Reports.</hi> the Doctors affirmed, that 17 years of age was a full age as to an infant Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor to diſpoſe of Goods: this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion hath been by others ſithence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed. Sir <hi>Edward Cook,</hi> 11 part, <hi>Inſt. ſect.</hi> 123. ſaith, He muſt be 10. which is the time of <hi>plena pubertas,</hi> 2. <hi>Hen.</hi> 4.12. an infant of 18. years of age may be a deiſſeiſſour. Sir <hi>Jo. Doderigge</hi> in his booke called, <hi>The Office and Duty of Executors;</hi> which they ſay is his, and it is a learned and laborious Treatiſe, <hi>fol.</hi> 347. delivers that this opinion of 17. yeares, for that ability in an infant, hath been reported other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. This latter opinion comes nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer the Common Law, and the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Law of the Land; which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, and Statue Law, gives in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants no power by Deed or Will to make any diſpoſition of any thing, 
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:119307:102"/>they have, before they be 21 yeares of of age.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems alſo more reaſonable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe infants at 18 yeares have by the intendment of Law, as they grow in yeares, more uſe of reaſon, to diſcern what is fit for them to doe and act. And for a meere ſtranger to ſue in a Court of Conſcience, who pretends by ſuch Wills of infants (the infant Husband being raviſhed) againſt the will of the Kindred of the deceaſed, who dyed ſix yeares ſithence without iſſue (being 17 yeares of age) and that any part of his part of his eſtate ſhould go that way by a courſe of Equity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the Law be for Mr. <hi>Erneley,</hi> who heyd not a penny with his Daughter, and who would have the Husband of his daughter bring him a portion, by his pretended title of an Executor of an Executor of an Execueor, <hi>viz.</hi> of an infant the Executor of another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, the Executor of a third perſon, ſeems very ſtrange.</p>
                  <p>The ſaid Licenſed Hiſtoriographer of theirs, hath publiſhed the 16 of this preſent Moneth of <hi>February,</hi> 1647. <hi>that</hi> I <hi>out of a deſire to keep the Eſtate have in a ſuite in the Court of wards, in my Couſins life time, pleaded to the Iurisdiction of that Court.</hi> It is true, I<pb n="186" facs="tcp:119307:102"/>did ſo; for I conceived that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate would be unſafe in Mr. <hi>Ernley's</hi> hands, and I was willing to preſerve it titl my young Couſin came to be of age, to diſpoſe of it himſelfe, according as I was truſted.</p>
                  <p>The Law being, 
<note place="margin">32. H. 8. c. 46.4. pars inſt. fol. 201.202.</note> that the Court of <hi>Wards</hi> had no jurisdiction over the perſonall eſtate (for then the Marriage was paid for to the King, and all due to the King aſcertained.) It is true, that that was inſiſted upon as was juſt, for to preſerve the Eſtate from Mr. <hi>Erneley,</hi> who would have made what account he pleaſed to my Couſin at his full age: And this is the truth of that buſineſſe.</p>
                  <p>That I declined not the Jurisdiction of the <hi>Chancery,</hi> to keepe an Eſtate in my hand, appeares, by my declining long ſithence the power of the Houſe of Commons to examine me; and the <hi>Reformers</hi> have all my Eſtate: What would Mr. <hi>Ernley</hi> have, when they [the <hi>Reformers</hi>] have all already; or can have from me, if he had any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour?</p>
                  <p>J deſire the good people of this City to obſerve what notorious Vntruths their Licenſed Hiſtorigraphers publiſh, to delude the people: In this particular caſe they publiſh.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That the Suit againſt me, is in the behalfe of an Orphan:</hi> M. <hi>Earne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> (who is Plaintiffe in their Court) is a <hi>Wiltſhire</hi> Gentleman, at the leaſt of 50. years of age, there is their <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>That</hi> I <hi>made a ſpeech to the people at the Hall door., that the queſtioning of me for what</hi> I <hi>had done for the</hi> KING, <hi>was illegall; and that the Iudges had no power to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is ſaid that comming to the Barre, I ſtirred not my Hat; All the Lawyers then at the Barre were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; wherefore I held it a civility, to be alſo uncovered; and ſo I was, as they all know.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, That the E. of <hi>Mancheſter ſhould ſay,</hi> I <hi>received a great eſtate in money, of the Orphans estate;</hi> As there is no truth in it, ſo it is moſt untrue that the ſaid Lord ſo ſaid (as all men preſent can teſtifie.) The truth is, they care not what they do, what they ſay, what they ſwear, nor what they write; Witnes the Declaration of a prevailing party of the H. of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons, of the 11 of<pb n="188" facs="tcp:119307:103"/>this inſtant <hi>February<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>Fiftly; it is a publike notorious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth. 
<q>That the Parliament hath publiſhed a Declaration againſt the King, of the 11. of this inſtant <hi>Feb.</hi>
                     </q> whereas it is well known to be the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the prevailing party of the Houſe of Commons only, without the Lords; and ſo they would make that prevailing partie only to be the
